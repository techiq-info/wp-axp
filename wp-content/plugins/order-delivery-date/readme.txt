Order Delivery Date plugin allows businesses to create complex delivery schedules & thereby optimize their local deliveries. Store owners can deliver items at customer's chosen date & time, thereby improving customer service.

== Description ==

We believe that the post-purchase customer experience is as important as the acquisition process.

The plugin allows your customers to choose a delivery date & time on the checkout page. This reduces **cart abandonment by 50%**.

You can set **Custom Delivery Schedules** for different shipping zones, default shipping classes and the product categories. Set different working days of your company and the working days of your shipping company. 

The dates on which you do not deliver can be set as holidays in the calendar. Also, you can **disable delivery for Virtual or Featured products**.
